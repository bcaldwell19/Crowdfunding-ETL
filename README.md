# Crowdfunding-ETL

>Independent Funding is a crowdfunding platform for funding independent projects or ventures.
>Independent Funding has been growing, so now it needs to move all their accessible data from one large Excel file onto a PostgreSQL database. This way, the analytics team will be able to perform analysis and create reports for company stakeholders as well as individuals who donate to projects.

>Britta, a junior SQL developer, has been tasked with the following:

-Extracting and transforming the data from the large Excel file into four separate CSV files

-Creating a PostgreSQL database and tables by using an ERD

-Loading the CSV files into the database

-Performing SQL queries to generate reports for stakeholders

>In this Challenge, you’ll use Python, Pandas, and Jupyter notebooks to do the extract and transform phases. Specifically, you’ll extract and transform the backers’ contact information from a CSV file to create a DataFrame that will be exported as a CSV file. You'll then do the >load phase. Specifically, you’ll use the dataset to create an ERD and a table schema for creating a new table in the crowdfunding_db database. And, you’ll upload the CSV file that contains the backers’ information into this table. Finally, you’ll perform a data analysis on the >crowdfunding_db database by using SQL queries.

## Deliverable 1: Extract Data

The extraction process step was done using Python and the PANDAS library utilizing Jupyter Notebook. 

## Deliverable 2: Transform and Clean Data

The transfor and clean step was also done using Python and the PANDAS library utilizing Jupyter Notebook.

## Deliverable 3: Create an ERD and a Table Schema and Load the Data

The ERD was created using QuickDBD, and then a Table schema was created from the export that was created. The final step was to load the data into PGadmin using postgreSQL.

## Deliverable 4: SQL Analysis

Using PGadmin, several queries were created using the data from the crowdfunding data set.

This project demonstrated a simple extract,transform,load(ETL) pipeline.
