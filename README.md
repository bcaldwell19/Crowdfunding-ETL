# Crowdfunding-ETL

>Independent Funding is a crowdfunding platform for funding independent projects or ventures.
>Independent Funding has been growing, so now it needs to move all their accessible data from one large Excel file onto a PostgreSQL database. This way, the analytics team will be able to perform analysis and create reports for company stakeholders as well as individuals who donate to projects.

>Britta, a junior SQL developer, has been tasked with the following:

-Extracting and transforming the data from the large Excel file into four separate CSV files

-Creating a PostgreSQL database and tables by using an ERD

-Loading the CSV files into the database

-Performing SQL queries to generate reports for stakeholders
